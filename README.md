## Old Project

This is an old hobby OS project from 2009, started out of curiosity,
continued out of enjoyment, and abandoned when the goals were
clarified and the approach no longer suited.  Those goals live on and
are being accomplished in userland today by Mango.

## Synopsis

For instructions on compiling and running in QEMU, see the old
[README](README).  The API section there is empty because the notion
of userspace programs just barely existed at the end of the project's
life.

The most interesting thing about the kernel was the kernel's memory
allocation, since the goal was good IPC.  Most of the other code is
probably pretty pedestrian for hobby OSes.

A lot of learning took place over the course of this project, and its
last year of development is documened in the
[devlog](http://daniel3735928559.github.io/toast/ballast/index.xml)
