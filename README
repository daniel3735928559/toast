--COMPILE--
./make (when in the source dir)

This will generate a bootable image at source/kernel.img for writing to a floppy 
or similar.

--RUN--
In QEMU: qemu kernel.img -boot a -fda kernel.img -s -S (when in the source dir)

This enables us to use the command 'target remote :1234' from inside GDB to 
debug.  

--RUNNING APPLICATIONS--
See the API section below for documentation on how to write userspace programs.  
You can load your usespace program by placing it into the initrd: The file in 
the initrd called 'hello' will be loaded and executed on startup, so put your 
program in 'source/initrd/files/hello' and list it in 'source/initrd/manifest' 
with a line of the form '$s,hello' where $s is the size of your binary.  Then, 
while in /source/initrd, run ./rdgen (which will compile the ramdisk image to 
/source/initrd/initrd.img which will be ready to be compiled into the kernel 
binary at build-time).
