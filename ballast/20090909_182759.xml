An issue has arisen!  Where do we put the heaps we are allocating things in?
The evident answer is to have a heap for the heap structs.  But how do we make
this heap?  The answer is to kmalloc space for just that one heap (and
free-stack, which may in fact be rather large...) and then call not a `create'
function, but an initialize function on the pre-allocated struct (and such a
function should be made available for most of the data-structure types
anyway).
