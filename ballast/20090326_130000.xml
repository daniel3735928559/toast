Wrote skeleton RTL8029 initize and send routines according to RTL8029AS.pdf.

<p>
Now going back to to multitasking and initrd things after dinner.  
</p>

<p>
It's as yet a bit unclear how useful the initrd/vfs structure will be.  Rather
than have a file-system as a built-in paradigm, it seems better to just load a
block of starter nodes (which will include network drivers and hard disk
drivers and floppy drivers, of course, for loading anything else that might be
needed for initialization).  This amounts to essentially just throwing the VFS
out of kernel-land and sticking with a simplified concept of initrd, which is
nice and easy to implemenent.  
</p>

<p>
Naturally, the boot process can be logged and the initrd updated with whatever
is found to have been needed in the early stages of initialization, but that's
a separate matter.
