When I said earlier that the loading from floppy code worked fine, I meant
that it caused no faults and everything else worked as normal after inserting
it, and not that I'd actually tested that the ramdisk was actually in place.
And in fact, looking with xp/10 0x20000 in the QEMU monitor (Ctrl+Alt+2 when
in QEMU), we got all zeros.  Actually, this was discovered last night, and
lots of fiddling with placement and whatnot didn't seem to fix it, so I went
to sleep rather annoyed.

<p>
But today I realized that the make script would place the initrd.img at the
end of kernel.img, and because I presently just have a silly little 106-byte
test image in there, the final sector of the image wasn't filled.  And the
emulator will therefore not be able to read the final sector, (as part of it
extends to where the disk doesn't exist).  
</p>

<p>
Zero-padding the image remedies this just fine, and now we can see the image
as expected.  Whew.
