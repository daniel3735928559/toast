Another thought on augmenting the current plan for IPC: Rather than allowing
the splicing of connections, connections are simply given associated `ports'.
Then anyone who wants to splice a connection would instead make a connection
on that particular port.  It means the splicing thing is gone, but the only
real difference is that instead of connecting and saying `give me a
connection' you'd connect to listen on whatever port.
