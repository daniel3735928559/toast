HA!  Ha ha.  Ha...  Term is over, and time to get this thing moving again,
aye?  Um.  But where were we?  
</p>

<p>
Our goals from before went something like this: 
</p>

<p>
-Page-table remapping<br />
-Kernel struct allocator<br />
-Ramdisk loading<br />
-Userland/Syscalls<br />
-Multitasking<br />
-IPC
</p>

<p>
Where the first four were more or less done by the end of the previous break,
and the final two were given (in some sense) by the skeleton code above.
There remain worries about the allocator, however, which is somewhat untested,
so the best course of action seems to be to clean up the first four and get
them working together nicely, and then implement tasking/IPC on top (as this
should be somewhat easy as long as the allocator works--just allocate and fill
out the relevant structs as appropriate).
