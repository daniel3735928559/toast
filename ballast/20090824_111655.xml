<p>
Looking back, the two most horrendous debugging experiences of this project
were the PD 0x300/0xC00 mishap and this random trashing of memory.  Viewing
these as some kind of upper bound on the time needed to debug, it looks like I
can expect three to five days of solid work (as is available until just before
October) for each major milestone.  So it becomes relevant to consider which
of these remain: 
</p>

<p>
-Page-table remapping (code exists--should be easy)
    (20090825: Done)
</p><p>
-Kernel struct allocator (Hard, but mostly a frontend for the physmem mgr)
    (20090830: First version done)

</p><p>

-Ramdisk loading (code exists--should be OK) 
    (20090901: First version done)

</p><p>

-Userland/Syscalls (code exists, but this is an Intel thing, so be wary...)
    (20090903: All tricky parts are done)
</p><p>

-Multitasking (difficult--some code exists)

</p><p>

-IPC (also difficult--no code yet!).

</p><p>

And now we actually have a month to do just these, where our crude
approximation puts the ETA at 30 days and 36 are available.  .  

Go time. </p>
