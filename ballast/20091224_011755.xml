<p>
So, having a working allocator (should test whether slabs behave as well as
blocks appear to, but this will come), we can now get on to implementing the
three primitives we had decided on: nodes, events, and connections.  We handle
each in its turn, which should take place in that order.  
</p>

<p>
The interfaces and such for these has been discussed many times elsewhere, so
we summarize here: 
</p>

<code>
node: 
  create_node
  dump_node
  switch_to_node
</code>

<code>
connection: 
  connect
  disconnect
  send
  recv
</code>

<code>
event: 
  make_event
  dump_event
  fire
</code>
