<p>
I'd like to clarify this again, because I've been referring throughout to the
notion of a task when officially, there is no such notion.  
</p>

<p>
SCHEDULER: 
</p>

<p>
The scheduler has a list of active nodes and, for now, switches between them
in a simple rota.  This works independent of address space, but each behaves
like it's in its own address space (has its own stack and whatnot).  
</p>

<p>
LOADER: 
</p>

<p>
The loader is told where to load a given node and the only difference between
loading to a new address space and to an existing one is whether a new heap
needs to be made and whether there's any dynamic linking to do.  
</p>

Flowchart:

 Target address space exists? ----> Make it
   |                                  |
   | Yes                              |

   |                                  v
   |               Find valid place in address space for code
   |                                  |
   |                                  v             Yes
   +---------------------> Needs dynamic linking? ------> Link

                                      | No                 |
                                      v                    |
                            Make kernel stack  &lt;-----------+
                                      |
				      v
              Load code and set up task struct, node struct, and TSS
