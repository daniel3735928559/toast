<p>
A further issue with locating the ramdisk is where do we put it on the floppy,
and how do we pass this information to the kernel?  
</p>

<p>
One approach that we shall be happy to try shortly is to put the ramdisk in
some fixed place far above the kernel, say sector 0x100 and then happily load
from there as needed.  
</p>

<p>
There is a kludgy but general approach as well to have the make script fix all
the values once it has compiled everything so it can see how big the binaries
end up, but this is a bit nasty.
