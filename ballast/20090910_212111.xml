<p>
A few things that will need to be cleaned up at some point that we can do
without for the time being: 
</p>

<p>
-Getting a proper memory map (int 0x15, eax=0xE820) and handling this in the
   physmem manager<br />
-Checking the available video modes and setting the optimal one and passing
   the relevant data on to the video driver.  <br />
-Ensuring that the A20 line was actually enabled (and retrying if
not).  <br />
-Not assuming certain memmory is pre-zeroed (unclear as yet when or if this
   happens--will check code more carefully when the time comes).  <br />
</p>

<p>
This list may expand as I think of things.
