<p>
We have booting completed, which loads a pre-defined extent of blocks from the
floppy into RAM which are understood to contain the kernel, and jumps there
after initializing the video mode to something pre-determined.
</p>

<p>
Then we initialize paging and the kernel heap, which is a blob of code for
which I have partially forgotten the inner workings but which is not quite
correct--I need to identity-map more frames than I ought to get things working
at the moment (and thus set the heap further along).  I do not understand
this, and will go back and write up a more thorough description of what
happened there (as well as of the details of how this code works (despite that
most of it should be rather standard).
</p>

<p>
For now, though, we'll bash on regardless, as there is a workaround (namely,
ID-map a whole bunch of RAM until it works), which is terrible, but unlikely
to interfere with anything later on.
