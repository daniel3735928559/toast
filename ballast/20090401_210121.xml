Still no word on what's wrong.  Let's work through what happens: 
</p>

<p>
jmps to 0xC0100000, so needs to find that instruction in PTs.  
</p>

<p>
0xC0100000 >> 22 = 0x300, so will look in table 0x300, which, as we see in the
above mappings, is given as the table at 0xC000.  Further, 0xC0100000 %
0x1000000 = 0x100000, and 0x100000 / 0x1000 = 0x100, so the 0x100th entry in
our page table should be the one we're accessing, and behold, that points to
memory address 0x10000, which is where the kernel is.  
</p>

<p>
Memdump from gdb is suspicious--there is stuff starting around 0xffd0.  Are we
overwriting code by dumping the kernel at 0x10000?
