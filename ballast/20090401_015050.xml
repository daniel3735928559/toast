A more big-picture thing now: What we want at the end is for programs to have
their interfaces entirely defined programmatically.  That is, for example,
where programs would ordinarily have a GUI element--a slider, say--that sets
some variable, it'll now have a means of doing so entirely via IPC, which can
be given a layer in the form of a GUI or a shell interface or whatever.  The
shell interface element of this would be reasonably useful, so as long as this
is implemented intelligently it is necessarily strictly better.
