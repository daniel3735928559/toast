We've moved the kernel-loading code into stage two and got the vidmem pointer
out, albeit with a bit more difficulty with worrying about the +BASE and
whatnot, which I don't fully understand yet.  
</p>

<p>
At any rate, QEMU likes it fine and I can evidently receive interrupts and
such without a problem, but RHW triple faults.  As far as I have experimented,
it occurs well after paging is enabled, so further debugging is in order...  
</p>

<p>
Ah, I've left in a stray
</p>

<code>
mov eax,0xF00000000
mov [eax],0xFFFFFFFF
</code>

<p>
which explains that.  (RHW box has vidmem at 0xFD000000, QEMU has 0xF0000000.)
</p>

<p>
After fixing that...Success!  Keyboard input even works on RHW (not in QEMU
though).  
</p>

<p>
Cool.  On to paging now.
