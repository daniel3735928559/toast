The $64,000 question is: True or false.  0x8E00 is divisible by 0x1000.  
</p>

<p>
Me: True!
</p>

<p>
!?!???!!?!??!
</p>

<p>
Paging works now.  Note to future self: align 0x1000 in the asm does alignment
at assembly time, so if you then link at 0x7E00, say, it's not gonna be 4K
aligned in RAM!  
</p>

<p>
Now let's see if that jumping business works.  
</p>

<p>
TRIPLE FAULT!
</p>

<p>
There was that whole `lea' deal.  We now look into that...
</p>

<p>
Got bochs running.  It says the problem is that the page for 0xC010000 is not
present.  I have a bad record with these page-mapping deals.  We'll see what
idiocy has given rise to this latest waste of many hours...
