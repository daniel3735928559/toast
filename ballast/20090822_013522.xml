Now we can plot pixels to the screen, which is good, and now we don't have any
stray 0xF80's or 0xF8000000's or any such things hard-coded in (hopefully!),
so this should work consistently across different machines now...
</p>

<p>
In fact, it even gets to kmain (where kmain is blank) OK now!  We've made
progress (back to where we were at 20090404, apparently)!  
</p>

<p>
And we can again print!  
</p>

<code>
--OUT
esp: 8FFE0
vidstart: FD000000
HELLO PAGED WORLD!
--END OUT
</code>

<p>
Now we've got to get the hh paging set up correctly...  (As is unsurprising,
uncommenting the call to paging_init in kernel.c causes a triple fault.)
