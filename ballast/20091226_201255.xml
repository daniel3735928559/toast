<p>
Because we are going to be dealing with nodes in our working with tasking, it
would be nice if most of our paging functions worked with pagedirs via nodes,
and with pagedir structs that coincide with what we want to be working with
later on, rather than the rather specific thing they deal in now.

<p>
And after a brief terrifying series of triple faults resulting from zeroing
structs after setting them up, it seems we have success.
