<p>
The kheap utilizes the physmem allocator quite a bit, and seems to work
decently, so we'll just need to test kheap.  
</p>

<p>
After realizing that expand populated the descriptors slightly incorrectly,
allocating appears to work.  
</p>

<p>
And indeed, after realizing that get_block_info is called as
</p>

<code>
  get_block_info(heap, block_start, &amp;info);
</code>

<p>
and not as 
</p>

<code>
  get_block_info(heap, &amp;info, block_start);
</code>

<p>
free seems to work as well.  YAY!
