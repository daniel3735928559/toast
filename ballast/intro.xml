<intro>
<p>Welcome to ballast--the dev log for the abortive kernel project
formerly known as Toast.  It was mainly written in
stream-of-consciousness and only for my own personal reference, so I
don't vouch for the coherence or utility of the content here.</p>

<p>Toast was a valuable learning experience, and the old project page
can still be found <a href="../index.html">here</a>.  The interesting
bit of the kernel, or at least, the bit that I was actually most
interested in actually seeing live--its IPC system design--was
eventually moved to userland and became <a
href="../../suit/mango">mango</a>.  </p>

<p>Toast was initiated some time in 2007, after many much less
well-informed efforts toward a pure assembly bootloader and kernel.
Ballast was started later to alleviate the problem of `what command
did I use last week to run qemu?' or `Didn't I fix a problem in this
line of code a month ago?'</p>

<p>ballast was originally maintained in a single plain-text file, and
recently an army of bash scripts was employed to bludgeon it into its
current form.  The original can be found <a
href="./ballast">here</a>.</p>
