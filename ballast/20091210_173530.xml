No, sorry--just kidding.  Revising the allocator and realizing that the
conversion data address -> descriptor address and back is nasty, (albeit O(1)),
and therefore considering whether we can save on some of this at least by
storing more information.  For instance, we can convert backwards more easily
by storing physical block address in the descriptor, and then the only problem
is going the other way, but at least this is possible.
