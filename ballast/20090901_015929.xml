<p>
After recompiling (maybe I was working off an old version?) rdgen.c and fixing
compatability problems (the rdgen struct had size before start and the
initrd.c struct had them reversed!) and general stupidity, the ramdisk seems
to be working.  More rigorous tests will be done in the future, but for now we
move on to userland!
